1. ðŸŽ–Write a function named calculateDogAge that:
  * [ ] Takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
  * [ ] Calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
  * [ ] Outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"
  * [ ] Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years.

```js
// your code goes here
```
2. ðŸŽ–Write a function named calculateSupply that:
  * [ ] takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
  * [ ] calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
  * [ ] outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
  * [ ] Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.

```js
// your code goes here
```
3. ðŸŽ–Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:
  * [ ] Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
  * [ ] Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NNÂ°C is NNÂ°F".
  * [ ] Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:
  * [ ] Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
  * [ ] Convert it to celsius and output "NNÂ°F is NNÂ°C."

```js
// your code goes here
```
4. ðŸŽ–The function below returns true if the parameter age is greater than 18. Otherwise it asks for a confirmation and returns its result:

```js
function checkAge(age) {
  if (age > 18) {
    return true;
  } else {
    // ...
    return confirm("Did parents allow you?");
  }
}
```
  4.1 ðŸŽ–Convert the above function using ternary operator.
  ```js
  // your code goes here
  ```

  4.2 ðŸŽ–Convert the above function using `||` operator.
  ```js
  // your code goes here
  ```
Will the function work differently if else is removed like below?

```js
function checkAge(age) {
  if (age > 18) {
    return true;
  }
  // ...
  return confirm("Did parents allow you?");
}
```
Is there any difference in the behavior of these two variants? If there is what is that?


5. ðŸŽ– Write a function pow(x,n) that returns x in power n.

  * [ ] Use prompt to take values for x and n, and then shows the result of pow(x,n) using alert.
  * [ ] In this task the function should support only natural values of n: integers greater then 1.

```js
// Your code goes here

// After writing code uncomment to check the answer.
// pow(3, 2); // 9
// pow(3, 3); // 27
// pow(1, 100); // 1
// pow(-31, 2); // "The number below 1 is not allowed"

6. ðŸŽ–Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,â€¦,n. Return the result accordingly.

```js
// your code goes here
```
6. ðŸŽ–Write a program that asks the user for a number n using prompt and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n

```js
// your code goes here
```
7. ðŸŽ–Modify the previous program such that only multiples of 5 or 7 are considered in the sum, e.g. n = 20 (5,7,10,14,15,20) 71

```js
// your code goes here
```

8. ðŸŽ–Write a function `min` that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.

```js
// Your code here.

console.log(min(0, 10));
// â†’ 0
console.log(min(0, -10));
// â†’ -10
```
